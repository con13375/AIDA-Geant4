# AIDA-Geant4

I'm starting this off from the B3a example from GEANT4. It reproduces the six Si detectors, including the conectors, plastic holders, and klapton strips, and the four titanium bars and 24 nuts on them. The events generated will be the betas themselves and maybe even the implantation or the passing through of light C or O ions. It records the energy deposited in the Si detector and the location of those deposits.
