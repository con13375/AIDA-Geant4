# AIDA

Folders and code in the master branch.

I'm starting this off from the B3a example from GEANT4. It will reproduce the six detectors, including the conectors, plastic holders, and klapton strips, and the four titanium bars and 24 nuts on them. The events generated will be the betas themselves and maybe even the implantation or the passing through of light C or O ions.
